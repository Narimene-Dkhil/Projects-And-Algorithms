# Contains

Add a method `contains(value)` to your SLL class, which is given a value as a parameter.  Return a boolean (true/false); true, if the list possesses a node that contains the provided value.

```
 class SLL {
    // constructor, other methods, removed for brevity
    contains(value) {
    	// is "value" to be found anywhere in this list?
    }
 }
```
