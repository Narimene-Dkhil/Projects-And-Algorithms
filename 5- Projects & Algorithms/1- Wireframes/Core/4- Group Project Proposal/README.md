# Group Project Proposal

It's time for your Group Project!  The technical requirements are the same as your Solo Project. Begin by finding other students you would like to work with to create a group of 3-4.  If you are having trouble finding partners, your Instructor will help facilitate.  Then, just like for your Solo Project, provide a description and wireframe of your proposed project idea.  In addition, list the names of each person in your group along with their primary role in the project.  For example:

Devon: Front-End

Jason: Back-End and API integration

You are expected to start a brand new project for your resume. **Your project should NOT be related to a belt exam, a past full-stack assignment, or a group member's Solo Project.**

**Every member of your group needs to hand in the Proposal.**

## Requirements:

- Text file that features a description of the project and a feature list. Provide features to be included in the MVP, all other features include in a product backlog. Include the names of group members and their primary role on project. Lastly, provide in the text file your group's GitHub repo link.
- Provide a wireframe image of project.
- Zip/compress all of this in a folder, and submit it for this assignment. Your instructor may want an email with this folder also to approve your project.
