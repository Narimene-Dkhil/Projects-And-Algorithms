# Re-Envisioning Your Schedule
### Learning Objective:

- Students will apply an understanding of the rigor of Projects & Algos to revising their daily schedule.

## What's Different About Projects & Algos?
Many students notice that they must take special care when scheduling their life around Projects and Algos. While at least 15 hours of the week will be spent creating a project, it's important to remember that algorithms will also need time, effort, and attention. These problem-solving challenges will require your mental space and a lot of focus, and you will want to schedule them thoughtfully. In order to set yourself up for success, it is essential to anticipate the additional challenges of this new programming language, and to plan for them! 

With that in mind, **it's time to re-examine your weekly schedule**. Consider whether you'll need to make any accommodations within your calendar in order to stay on pace throughout this final, but challenging, part of your bootcamp experience.

1. Begin by either finding your original planner, or making a copy of the planner template.
    1. If you're a **full-time** student, [make a copy of this planner](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DNbvjV_HgDJtPIwAQNRo65N3MnUrLsUMzEUQu8aNtCM/copy). 
    2. If you're a **part-time** or **flex** student, [make a copy of this planner](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lUDC3Mvktdcif995EZRYQAnNmGdSf3Hp4dHFEihuZyU/copy). 
2. Look at the example tab and think: what sorts of daily and weekly activities would I need to include in my schedule? What can I delegate to someone else until after bootcamp? A great question to help guide your work is "what am I going to give up in my schedule now, so that I can prioritize my learning for tomorrow?"
3. Use the blank template to create your own weekly schedule. Be sure that you set a rigorous - *but realistic* - daily cadence. 
4. Once you've allocated your bootcamp and non-bootcamp time, turn in your schedule below and continue on!
